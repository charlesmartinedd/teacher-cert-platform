It involves recognizing that spoken words are made up of individual sounds (phonemes) and being able to manipulate these sounds.

Drafting**: Getting ideas down on paper\n• Focus on content, not perfection\n• Don't worry about mistakes\n• Get thoughts flowing\n• Can be messy and revised later\n\n**3. Revising**: Improving content and organization\n• Add, delete, rearrange, substitute\n• Focus on ideas, word choice, sentence fluency\n• Get feedback from peers or teacher\n• May require multiple revision cycles\n\n**4. Editing**: Correcting mechanics\n• Fix spelling, grammar, punctuation, capitalization\n• Use checklists or rubrics\n• Peer editing partnerships\n• Teacher conferences\n\n**5. Publishing**: Sharing final work\n• Type or write in final form\n• Add illustrations or formatting\n• Share with authentic audience\n• Celebrate achievement\n\nNot all writing needs to go through all five stages - daily writing practice can stop after drafting.",
